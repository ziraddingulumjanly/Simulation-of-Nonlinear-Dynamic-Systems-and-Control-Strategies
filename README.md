# Simulation-of-Nonlinear-Dynamic-Systems-and-Control-Strategies
This repo presents solutions to a series of control engineering problems involving nonlinear system analysis, equilibrium and stability assessment, PID controller design, gain scheduling. The problems explore theoretical methods such as Lyapunov stability, as well as practical control design and simulation in MATLAB/Simulink.
